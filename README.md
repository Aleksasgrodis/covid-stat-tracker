# **Covid Statistics Tracker**

Your one stop shop for the latest statistics and news on the ongoing pandemic.


### `The Goal`

As part of the [\</SALT>](https://salt.study/) bootcamp, each student must build a web application with an idea of their own in one single day. Also known as `Hackday üë®‚Äçüíª`. The goal is to apply the coding knowledge acquired over the last few months of learning and show what you can do. The only limitation being a time constraint, you only get 24 hours to finish your project, so planning and thinking ahead is key.

### `The Idea`
The idea is pretty straightforward. It will be a webapp displaying global Covid19 statistics upon initial load, with the ability to go in-depth into statistics by filtering out specific countries and the data available through an external API. Besides that, as a nice add-on I would like to implement an RSS feed of the latest news related to the pandemic and of course, the vaccine status. Last but not least, it has to be appealing. So will be sure to give it a nice coat, and implement some nice eye-candy if everything goes according to plan.
